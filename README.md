This project was my implementation of the Connect Four game, made with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. On top of the default game, the row, column and winning sequence numbers are adjustable and more than 2 players (with custom names and colors) can play.

Connect Four is a game in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.
