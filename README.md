Rules: It is the goal of the game to connect four of your tokens in a line. All directions (vertical, horizontal, diagonal) are allowed. Players take turns putting one of their tokens into one of the seven slots. A token falls down as far as possible within a slot. The player with the red tokens begins. The game ends immediately when one player connects four stones.

Rules:
The four in a row rules are very simple. Itâ€™s always played with 2 players and in a 7x6 grid. Each turn each player puts a piece of his color inside a column and it will fall until it reaches the lowest available spot. The one who can put 4 pieces of the same color in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins. If no one manages to do it then the match ends in a draw.
